# Summary

A [wind rose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_rose) is a graphic tool used by meteorologists to give a succinct view of how wind speed and direction are typically distributed at a particular location.

A wind rose can also be used to describe visually air quality.

Windrose is Python to manage wind data, draw windrose 
(also known as a polar rose plot), draw probability density function and fit Weibull distribution

It's using Matplotlib as a backend.

Data can be passed as Numpy array and as Pandas DataFrame.

# Future
Windrose is still an evolving library which still need care from its users and developers. A better API for video exporting could be an interesting improvement.
