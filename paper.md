# Summary

A [wind rose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_rose) is a graphic tool used by meteorologists to give a succinct view of how wind speed and direction are typically distributed at a particular location.

A wind rose can also be used to describe visually air quality.

Windrose is a Python library to manage wind data, draw windrose 
(also known as a polar rose plot), draw probability density function and fit Weibull distribution

It's using Matplotlib as a backend.

Data can be passed using Numpy array or using Pandas DataFrame.

# Install

## Requirements
- matplotlib http://matplotlib.org/
- numpy http://www.numpy.org/
- and naturally python https://www.python.org/ :-P

Option libraries:
- Pandas http://pandas.pydata.org/ (to feed plot functions easily)
- Scipy http://www.scipy.org/ (to fit data with Weibull distribution)
- ffmpeg https://www.ffmpeg.org/ (to output video)
- click http://click.pocoo.org/ (for command line interface tools)

## Install latest release version via pip
A package is available and can be downloaded from PyPi and installed using:

```bash
$ pip install windrose
```

## Install latest development version

```bash
$ pip install git+https://github.com/python-windrose/windrose
```

or

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/python-windrose/windrose
$ python setup.py install
```

# Examples

Bar plot is the most common plot

-![Windrose (bar) example](docs/screenshots/bar.png)

Plotting contour plot is also possible

-![Windrose (contourf-contour) example](docs/screenshots/contourf-contour.png)

Several windroses can be plotted using subplots to provide a plot per year with for example subplots per month

-![Windrose subplots](docs/screenshots/subplots.png)

Probability density function (pdf) can be plotted. and fitting Weibull distribution can be achieved thanks to Scipy.

# Future
Windrose is still an evolving library which still need care from its users and developers.
* Map overlay is a feature that could help some users.
* A better API for video exporting could be an interesting improvement.
